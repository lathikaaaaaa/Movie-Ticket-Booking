# 🎟️ Movie Ticket Booking App

This is a web-based movie ticket booking application built using vanilla JavaScript and the OMDb API. Users can search for movies, view details, select seats, and proceed to payment.

## 🌟 Features
- 🔍 Search movies via OMDb API
- 🎬 View movie details like poster, plot, and release date
- 🪑 Interactive seat selection
- 💸 Simple booking confirmation with localStorage simulation

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- OMDb API

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure all `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files are in the same directory
3. Open `home.html` in your browser to start
4. Ensure you’re connected to the internet (for OMDb API to work)


## 📌 Notes
- This is a frontend-only project. Booking and payments are simulated using `localStorage`.
- Replace the API key in JS files with your own OMDb key if rate-limited.
